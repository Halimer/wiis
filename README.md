# Achieving the CIS Benchmark on AWS with Evident


## Lab Overview
In this lab you will gain experience in configuring AWS services to be compliant with the CIS Benchmark based on feedback from Evident. Using Evident you will identify misconfigurations and non-best practices in an AWS environment and figure out remediation actions. Using the AWS console and command line interface you will resolve those issues. You will then finish by deploying native AWS services to ensure ongoing security of your environment.
